## 🚀 Featured Project — Trainalyze
**Trainalyze** is a real-time gym monitoring system that uses **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** for motion detection and tracking.  
It captures each person’s workout in real-time and provides performance data to both the **individual** and the **gym trainer**.

### 🧠 Core Idea
- Tracks people entering the gym and identifies them using video feed.  
- Monitors their workout form, duration, and consistency.  
- Logs data to provide detailed progress insights for trainers and users.

### ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **YOLO** for motion & person detection  
- **Python** for backend logic and data processing  
- **OpenCV** for video feed handling  
- **ESP32 / IoT integration** for sensor data (optional module)  

### 📊 Output
- Real-time workout tracking dashboard  
- Statistical data on performance improvement  
- Alerts for improper form or inactivity
